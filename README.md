# Using-Python-to-Analyse-Monkey-Pox


Monkeypox is an infectious viral disease that affects humans and some animals. Symptoms include fever, swollen lymph nodes, and a rash that develops into blisters before crusting over. In this project, I conducted an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a monkeypox dataset to investigate various trends and insights. Through data analysis, the following questions were explored:

Global distribution of confirmed monkeypox cases
Top 10 countries by confirmed cases
Top 5 countries by suspected cases
Top 10 countries by hospitalized cases
Patterns in travel history among affected individuals
Correlation between travel history and confirmed cases
Correlation between travel history and suspected cases
Common symptoms among monkeypox-infected individuals"
